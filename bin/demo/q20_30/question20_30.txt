Ans 23 : Write the java program to store image in database?
 
 in the seperate the we will get the file name through the form as the multipart
 then we are random uuid so that the we can add to the image name 
 so that all the image name will be unique.
 we were also compressing the image to that it can be save to byte code in database.

	public String uploadImage( MultipartFile file) throws IOException {
		String fileExtension = StringUtils.getFilenameExtension(file.getOriginalFilename());
		UUID uuidString= UUID.randomUUID();
		Image image = new Image();
		image.setImageName(uuidString+"."+fileExtension);
		image.setType(file.getContentType());
		image.setImageData(ImageUtil.compressImage(file.getBytes()));
		imageRepository.save(image);
		
		return "file Uploaded successfully "+uuidString+"."+fileExtension;
	}
	
	this is post request to upload the image file to data base
	
		@PostMapping("/upload")
	public String uploadImage(@RequestParam("image") MultipartFile file) throws IOException {
		imageService.uploadImage(file);
		return "image";
	}
